        <h1>The Things I Love</h1>
          <p>On top of the things that I love is of course my family. I am nothing without them, I am doing all of this because of them. Next is music. I love music since I was a kid. I remember, I used to have a pile of song books back in my childhood days. Next to that is technology.  I am a techie guy who crave for new technologies. I love watching online reviews regarding new techs, discoveries, creations as well as the unboxing of new and trending gadgets in the market today, and follow the latest trends on the web. I also love to travel. I've been to many gorgeous places here in the Philippines and the experience so far was extra-ordinary!</p>
